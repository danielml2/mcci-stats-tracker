 MCCI Stats Tracker 
 </h1>
A minecraft fabric mod, that uses game features to track your stats in those games.

**NOTE: As of this early version, the stats won't save after you quit, and configuration is a bit limited. Will be improving later on**

Currently, the mod tracks every game but the Dojo, especially because it's a solo mode so it's lower priority.
Realistically, this mod will become irrelevant the moment Noxcrew releases an actual stats viewer, but I thought I'd still try and make something that works for now. plus there might be a use for this to track stats that Noxcrew may not track/show on the theoretic future stats viewer.

## What stats are being tracked for ____?
Here's a full list of what stats are being tracked for each game.

| Game     | Stats Tracked |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Battle Box      | Kills, Deaths, KDR (Kill/Death ratio), Round Wins, Losses, WLR (Win/Loss Ratio), Last & Average personal, same for team placement.       |
| Sky Battle | Kills, Deaths, KDR (Kill/Death ratio), Average & Last for survivor, personal and team placements.
| Parkour Warrior Survivor | Average Leap Placements (In current game), Average Game Placements, Average & Best Time per Leap (Leap 1, 2, 3.. etc), Last game placement
| TGTTOS (To Get To The Other Side)   | Average for round placements, game placements, Best completion/whack time for current map, last game placement         |
| Hole In The Wall | Last & Average Game Placement, Top Wall Speed survived, 

## Are my stats local?
Yes! And always will be. In the future, it will save for you to view on a file, but currently the data dissapears after you close the game.
